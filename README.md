# Java Tutorials

A series of Java tutorials starting from the honourable "Hello World!" and going to infinity and beyond!

You can follow the series on http://jamesfarrugia.blogspot.com.  The repository is organised 
into a number of directories, one for every post.  As the first posts are very basic, there
will be no complex project files (as advanced users may expect).  However, as we go along, we
shall cover the tools of the trade and improve our toolchain until maven et al. are present.

Thank you for coming by!
