The repository is organised \r\ninto a number of directories, one for every post.  As the first posts are very basic, there\r\nwill be no complex project files (as advanced users may expect).  However, as we go along, we\r\nshal cover the tools of the trade and improve our toolchain until maven et al. are present.\r\n\r\nThank you for coming by!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
